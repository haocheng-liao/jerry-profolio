I am a undergraduate student in Economic in UCLA  and an intern at the DiDi company for Leadership Advisory research. My research interests include Human resource strategy, Dynamic portfolio investment and competitive strategy. I am passionate about the development and implementation of tools that increase the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of scientific research. 

My favorite letter in the alphabet is R, and I am weirdly evangelical about it. I co-teach Data & Decisions --- a graduate-level, introductory class on probability and statistics using {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} --- and I'm a technical mentor for the Stanford Data Science for Social Good program. I learn by teaching, so I consider myself very lucky!
